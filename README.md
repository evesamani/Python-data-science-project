# Python-data-science-project
Python data science project conducted with @audreybov under the supervision of Romain Avouac for the elective course of "Python pour la data science" followed from September 2024 to January 2025 (second year of engineering cycle at ENSAE IP Paris).
\\
Date of the project : from end of October 2024 to end of December 2024

**Subject : The impact of climate change and human activities on puffin population.**

**Motivations** : the common puffin (macareux moine en fran√ßais) is a small bird from North Atlantic Ocean which breeds in large colonies on costal cliffs or offshore islands, especially in Russia, Iceland, Ireland, British, Norway and the Faore Islands. Climate change and the increase of the sea surface temperature lead to difficulties to feed themselves during the breeding season and human activities. Today, puffins are declared a vulnerable species because of the decreasing of the population. That is why we would like to determine the evolution of puffin population over the past decades, their geographical location and the correlation between climate change, human activities and the decreasing of puffin population. As a bonus, puffin population trends can be predicted.
